FORCE: [Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is an open source software created by David Frantz. It allows users to download, process and coregister Sentinel-2 data to generate analysis-ready data. FORCE thus, serves as a one-stop solution for Sentinel-2 data. In this supplementary course, we learn the basics of working with FORCE, command line, docker and using Sentinel-2 and Landsat  data to generate spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), etc.



# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to
  
* Learn basics of FORCE, Ubuntu and command line
* Learn basics of downloading and processing Sentinel-2 data
* Learn how to coregister Sentinel-2 using Landsat data
* Learn how to generate spectral indices



# Setting

Please seriously check and follow the [Information on the Coronavirus](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/universitaet/administration/sicherheit/coronavirus){:target="_blank"} of the University of Marburg.
{: .notice--info}





# Preparation and prerequisites

The course assumes basic knowledge of remote sensing. Skills with the Linux command line are advantageous. This course is a supplementary course for the [Upscaling Biodiversity](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-mpg-upscaling/) and [geoAI](https://geomoer.github.io/geoAI/) courses.

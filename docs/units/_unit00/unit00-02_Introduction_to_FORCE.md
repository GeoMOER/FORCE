## FORCE: Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring

FORCE is an open source software designed to generate analysis ready data from remote sensing imageries. 

## Why FORCE

Searching, downloading and processing satellite imageries are time consuming, require very detailed expertise. FORCE provides a "one-stop" solution to this and it allows users to generate analysis ready data within one environment.

## Which sensors?

FORCE allows the download and processing of Landsat 4/5TM , Ladsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8/9 OLI and Sentinel-2 A/B MSI.

## What can you do with FORCE

* Download satellite data
* Detect clouds
* Perform geometric correction
* Perform radiometric correction (this includes atmospheric correction with multiple scattering effects, image-based AOD estimation, topographic correction, adjacency effect correction, and nadir BRDF correction)
* Time series analysis
* Generate spectral indices
* Land cover fraction mapping 

**Note** Since the software is regularly updated, more features will be added in the future.

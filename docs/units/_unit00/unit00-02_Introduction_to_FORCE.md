## FORCE: Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring

FORCE is an open source software designed to generate Analysis Ready Data from remote sensing imagery. 
The main page of FORCE can be accessed [here](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Why FORCE

Searching, downloading and processing satellite imagery are time consuming and require very detailed expertise. FORCE provides a "one-stop" solution to this and it allows users to generate Analysis Ready Data within one environment.

## Which sensors?

FORCE allows the download and processing of Landsat 4/5TM , Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8/9 OLI and Sentinel-2 A/B MSI.

## What can you do with FORCE

* Download satellite data
* Detect clouds
* Perform geometric correction
* Perform radiometric correction (this includes atmospheric correction with multiple scattering effects, image-based AOD estimation, topographic correction, adjacency effect correction, and nadir BRDF correction)
* Time series analysis
* Generate spectral indices
* Land cover fraction mapping 

**Note** Since the software is regularly updated, more features will be added in the future.
